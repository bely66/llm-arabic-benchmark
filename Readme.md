# Overview

This project goal is to create a simple comparison between the top LLMs that has multi-linguil capabilities with Arabic currently: LLAMA3.1-405B, Command-R+, GPT4o, AceGPTv2-30B.

# Data
I collected small dataset to test broad range of model capabilities in Tasks like math quizes, following instructions and rules, summarization, ner.

I tried to make the tasks challenging because they were very small in number.

# Todo
- [x] Collect data
- [ ] Add parser for OpenAI GPT4o, GPT4o-mini
- [ ] Add parser for LLAMA3.1-405B
- [ ] Add parser for AceGPTv2-30B
- [ ] Add parser for Command-R+
- [ ] Add adapter for each task
- [ ] Qualitative analysis
- [ ] Quantitative analysis (still not sure how yet for some tasks it will be easy like word count, json formatting, for others like summarization it will be hard)

# Results
Still not available
